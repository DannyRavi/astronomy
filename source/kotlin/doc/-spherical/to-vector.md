# toVector

fun [toVector](to-vector.md)(time: [Time](../-time/index.md)): [Vector](../-vector/index.md)

Converts spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.

Given spherical coordinates and a time at which they are valid, returns a vector of Cartesian coordinates. The returned value includes the time, as required by the type [Vector](../-vector/index.md).

## Parameters

| | |
|---|---|
| time | The time that should be included in the return value. |
