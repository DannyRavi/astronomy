#   Example Python program for Astronomy Engine:
#   https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy
#
#   Calculates the coordinates of Jupiter and its four major moons
#   (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) as seen from the Earth
#   at a given date and time. This program illustrates how to correct
#   for the delay caused by the time it takes for light to reach
#   the Earth from the Jupiter system.

    # Tricky: I'm "cheating" a little bit below by adding Vector `jv`
    # to StateVector `jm.<moon>`, to result in a Vector position for each moon.
    # This works because StateVector has all the fields that Vector has,
    # plus the velocity components (vx, vy, vz).
    # This is alarming to type purists, but just another normal day of
    # "duck typing" for Pythonistas.
