This folder contains test data generated by the
JPL Horizons online tool:

https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi

This is for testing Astronomy Engine calculations
of the positions of Jupiter's major 4 moons.

To reproduce this data, you need to create 12 files
for (4 moons) * (3 aberrations).
The moons are 0=Io, 1=Europa, 2=Ganymede, 3=Callisto.
The aberrations are geometric, astrometric, apparent.
The files are named: jm_<aberration>_<moon>.txt.

Visit the tool and select the following parameters:

Ephemeris Type: VECTORS

Target Body:
    jm_*_0.txt = Io (JI) [501]
    jm_*_1.txt = Europa (JII) [502]
    jm_*_2.txt = Ganymede (JIII) [503]
    jm_*_3.txt = Callisto (JIV) [504]

Coordinate Origin: Jupiter (body center) [500@599]

Time Span:
    Start = JD 2446545.0,
    Stop  = JD 2456545.0
    Step  = 100 days

Table Settings:
    Type 2 (state vector x, y, z, vx, vy, vz)
    output units: au & au/d
    reference plane: ecliptic and mean equinox of reference epoch
    reference system: ICRF/J2000.0
    aberrations:
        jm_geometric_*.txt   = Geometric states
        jm_astrometric_*.txt = Astrometric states
        jm_apparent_*.txt    = Apparent states
    Check the "labels" box and "object page" boxes, but NOT delta-T or CSV.
