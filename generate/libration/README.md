These Moon Phase and Libration pages contain some wonderful videos, images, and explanatory text that
help make the complexities of the Moon's orbit and libration understandable.

# Further Reading

The PDF document [Computation of the Quantities Describing the Lunar Librations
in The Astronomical Almanac](https://astro.ukho.gov.uk/data/tn/naotn74.pdf) provides a
detailed explanation of the meaning of lunar libration quantities like sub-solar angles,
sub-earth angles, and polar position angles.
