# .NET Framework 4+

Astronomy Engine officially supports dotnet core (.NET 5+).
Currently I do all unit testing and development under .NET 6.
However, I make an effort to maintain backward compatibility
with .NET Framework 4+, although issues may slip through.

If you encounter problems with Framework builds, please submit
an issue and I will help you resolve them.

This directory contains a solution just to make sure
Visual Studio 2019 can build and run a simple program
in .NET Framework 4.7.2. It is a manual test only; it is not
included in the automated test suite.
